# Config override

The idea of the module is to make it easier to override configuration.

## Override mechanisms

Currently there are two override mechanisms

* A site wide override folder, you need to specify 'override' in your
  settings.php
* A module provided override mechanism. A module can override config by
  providing some yml files.
